This homework we continue improving the structure of our repository as a Reproducible Research Package, using again the code from the LIGO Gravitational Wave Detection Tutorial. This time, we add a bit more structure, tests, documentation, etc, to complete the picture. We also build the Jupyter Notebook for the LOSC. Click the link to see our works.
